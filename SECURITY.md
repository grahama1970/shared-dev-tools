# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The project aims to support the latest published release on PyPI (when available) and the `main` branch on GitHub. Older versions are not maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security issues privately:

1. Email the maintainers at `security@grahama.co` with a detailed description of the issue, proof-of-concept if available, and any suggested mitigations.
2. Alternatively, open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) pointing to this repository. Only maintainers will see your report.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days** and keep you informed as we triage the issue.

If the vulnerability results in leaked credentials or other sensitive data, rotate those secrets immediately and include the steps you took in your report.

## Disclosure Policy

Maintainers will coordinate a disclosure timeline with the reporter. In general we prefer to publish fixes before announcing the vulnerability. Credit will be given to reporters unless they request anonymity.
