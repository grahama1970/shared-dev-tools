I created a much smaller Tier‑1 “slim” bundle that fits
  comfortably under tight context limits.

  - Path: local/docs/review_bundle_tier1_slim.txt
  - Size: ~119 KB (well within typical web limits; far below
  400k tokens)
  - Contents: Only the most critical excerpts, plus both
  internal guides in full:
      - Guides (full): HAPPYPATH_GUIDE.md, SMOKES_GUIDE.md
      - Router (excerpts): acompletion(), aclose(), and context-
  manager region
      - Parallel ACompletions (full): litellm/router_utils/
  parallel_acompletion.py
      - HTTP transport (excerpts): core handler sections from
  http_handler.py and httpx_handler.py; support helpers included
  in full (async_client_cleanup.py, aiohttp_transport.py)
      - Optional-dep hotspots (excerpts): import regions
  (fastuuid) from types/utils.py, utils.py, litellm_logging.py,
  proxy/common_request_processing.py; bedrock/common_utils
  fastuuid region
      - MCP soft-deps (excerpts): imports + entrypoints from
  experimental_mcp_client/tools.py, client.py; responses/mcp/
  litellm_proxy_mcp_handler.py; types/mcp.py
      - Mini-Agent (core): arun_mcp_mini_agent() excerpt;
  full http_tools_invoker.py, agent_proxy.py, call_wrapper.py;
  research_tools.py call_openai_tool() excerpt

  How I pared it down

  - Large files (router.py, http handlers) are excerpted only
  around the critical functions with ±context.
  - Smaller helpers are included in full when safe and concise.
  - Optional-dep and MCP modules include just imports and
  entrypoints to review dependency guards.
  - Both guides are included in full so reviewers can judge
  alignment with your standards.

  If you want it even smaller

  - I can remove the full helpers and excerpt only the close/
  aclose regions.
  - I can trim the Mini-Agent adapters by excerpting only method
  signatures and error paths.
  - I can strip the guides to their “Principles” and “Smokes
  Checklist” sections (but generally reviewers need the full
  guides).

  Next steps

  - Submit local/docs/review_bundle_tier1_slim.txt to ChatGPT/
  Kimi-K2.
  - If the reviewer needs a “core-of-core” version (<50 KB),
  tell me your absolute size target and I’ll generate an ultra-
  slim version focusing on:
      - Router acompletion/aclose excerpts
      - One HTTP handler excerpt
      - fastuuid and MCP import regions
      - Mini-Agent loop excerpt only
      - Guides reduced to bullet checklists
