Developer: # ðŸ§­ Smokes Fixer â€” Self-Iterating Repair Loop

**Purpose:** Provide the agent with a single, deterministic path to resolve smoke test failures and circumvent infrastructure dead-ends.

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of the main sub-tasks you will perform before starting substantive work; keep items conceptual and avoid implementation detail.

## Prerequisites (Setup â€“ once per repository)
- Ensure `make exec-rpc-restart` and `make exec-rpc-probe` commands are available (these should operate on the Docker Compose `exec-rpc` service).
- Confirm `scripts/exec_rpc_probe.sh` is executable.
- Verify the `/__meta` endpoint returns both `git_sha` and `started_at`.
- Optionally, configure `context7` MCP for private recall and `perplexity-ask` MCP for public API semantics (these do not access repository code).

## Run-Time Parameters (Template-populated)
- Test selection: specify nodeids or markers.
- Time budgets: total repair loop wall-clock â‰¤ 10 minutes.
- Maximum loops: up to 10 iterations.
- Retry budget: a maximum of 3 attempts per unique failure signature.

## Repair Loop â€” Single Deterministic Path
1. **Baseline Test Run**  
   Execute: `pytest -q tests/smoke -k smoke --maxfail=3 -rf`
2. **Exec RPC Freshness Check**  
   If Exec RPC appears stale (e.g., missing `t_ms`), run `make exec-rpc-restart && make exec-rpc-probe`, then assert that `"t_ms"` is present in the probe.
3. **Error Signature Tracking**  
   Keyed on (nodeid, exception type, file:line, first error message line). Stop retrying a test after 3 identical attempts.
4. **Apply Patch**  
   Emit only a unified git diff (â‰¤ 5 files, â‰¤ 200 lines), without explanatory prose.
5. **Escalate Verbosity**  
   - 2nd attempt: include `--tb=short`
   - 3rd attempt: focus the rerun with `-vv -l -s --tb=long --maxfail=1 <nodeid>`.
6. **Verification and Rollback**  
   Re-run the baseline test. If failures increase, perform `git reset --hard && git clean -fd`. Then STOP and escalate the issue.
7. **Assisted Investigation (Optional, once per unique failure signature)**  
   - For private help: pass error text plus up to 40 lines of code context (top stack frame) to `context7`.
   - For public info: send only error text, public symbol names, and version details to `perplexity-ask`.  
   Escalate if still failing after this step.
8. **Stop Conditions**  
   Halt on any of the following:
   - All tests pass
   - Any signature reaches 3 attempts
   - Reached loop limit (10)
   - Patch changes >5 files or >200 lines
   - Repair loop time exceeds 10 minutes

After each substantive action (e.g., running tests, applying patches, restarting services), validate the outcome in 1-2 lines and determine whether to proceed, rollback, or escalate. If validation fails, self-correct where possible within allowed retry limits.

## Live ndsmoke Policy
- Default is **opt-out**.
- Enable explicitly using `ND_SMOKE=1` with deterministic sampling (`temperature=0`, `top_p=0`).

## Escalation Bundle (Required on Stop)
Provide a summary package that includes:
- **Reason** for escalation (retry budget exceeded, regression detected, patch size too large, or time budget expired).
- **Remaining Failures Table:** List of {nodeid, failure signature, attempts used} objects.
- **Repro Steps:** All exact pytest commands used, including any focused reruns.
- **Diff:** Last applied patch as unified diff.
- **Artifacts:**
  - `artifacts/smoke.html`
  - `artifacts/smoke.xml`
  - `requirements.snapshot.txt`
- **Exec RPC Freshness Checks:** Output from:
  - `curl -s 127.0.0.1:8790/__meta`
  - `ss -lntp | grep ':8790 '`

### Output Format
All outputs related to the Escalation Bundle must be provided as a single, valid JSON object using the schema below. If any required field is unavailable, use `null` or an empty list as appropriate. Field order must match exactly. Artifacts are provided as a list of file path strings. The failures table is a list of JSON objects (not CSV or Markdown). Commands and diffs are unadorned strings. Use this format:

```json
{
  "reason": "string (retry budget | regression | patch size | time budget)",
  "failures": [
    {
      "nodeid": "string",
      "signature": "string",
      "attempts": integer
    }
    // ... additional failing tests
  ],
  "repro_commands": [
    "string (pytest command)",
    // ... more focused rerun commands
  ],
  "last_patch_diff": "string (unified diff)",
  "artifacts": [
    "artifacts/smoke.html",
    "artifacts/smoke.xml",
    "requirements.snapshot.txt"
  ],
  "exec_rpc_freshness": {
    "meta": "string (output of curl -s 127.0.0.1:8790/__meta)",
    "ss": "string (output of ss -lntp | grep ':8790 ')")
  }
}
```

If any field (such as a command output or artifact file) cannot be collected at escalation time, set it to `null`.
